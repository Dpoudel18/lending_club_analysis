# Lending Club - Data Analysis and Visualization

Exploratory data analysis and visualization on Kaggle's [Lending Club Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneeshk/lending-loan-club-dataset).

Step 1: [Data Cleaning - Jupyter Notebook (with documentation)](https://dipeshpoudel.com/lending_club/data_cleaning.html)

Step 2: [Data Analysis and Visualization - Jupyter Notebook](https://dipeshpoudel.com/lending_club/data_analysis_and_visualization.html)

Step 3: [Web Dashboard](https://lending-club-data-analysis.herokuapp.com/)

***Note:** For best experience, open the html version to view the notebook (instead of .ipynb files). GitHub apparently doesn't render the html elements in markdown properly* 

## Locally running the Web Dashboard

``` 
streamlit run lendingClub_dashboard.py
```

## Dependencies

    plotly==5.1.0

    streamlit==0.85.1
